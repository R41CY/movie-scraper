# Job Failure Solutions

## Overview
This document outlines the solutions implemented to fix the failing job identified in the IMDb scraper workflow.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Python NoneType Subtraction Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
```
Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'float'
```

**Root Cause:** 
In `imdb_scraper_optimized.py`, the code attempted to subtract timing values that could be `None`:
- Line 441: `self.metrics.get('end_time', 0) - self.metrics.get('start_time', 0)`
- Line 88: Similar issue in `_log_performance_metrics` method

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added null checks before performing arithmetic operations
- Safe duration calculation with fallback values
- Updated both the Excel export and logging methods

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before (problematic)
duration = self.metrics.get('end_time', 0) - self.metrics.get('start_time', 0)

# After (safe)
start_time = self.metrics.get('start_time', 0)
end_time = self.metrics.get('end_time', 0)
duration = 0
if start_time is not None and end_time is not None and start_time > 0 and end_time > 0:
    duration = end_time - start_time
```

### 2. Shell Script Syntax Error in Log Processing ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
```
command substitution: line 34: syntax error near unexpected token `Performance'
```

**Root Cause:** 
The workflow tried to grep log content when the log file might not exist or be empty, causing shell command failures.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added file existence and non-empty checks: `[ -f "imdb_scraper.log" ] && [ -s "imdb_scraper.log" ]`
- Added fallback error handling with `|| echo "No performance metrics found in log"`
- Graceful handling of missing or empty log files

**Workflow Changes:**
```yaml
# Before
if [ -f "imdb_scraper.log" ]; then
  grep -E "(Performance Metrics|...)" imdb_scraper.log | tail -10 >> summary.md
fi

# After  
if [ -f "imdb_scraper.log" ] && [ -s "imdb_scraper.log" ]; then
  grep -E "(Performance Metrics|...)" imdb_scraper.log | tail -10 >> summary.md || echo "No performance metrics found in log" >> summary.md
else
  echo "Log file not available or empty" >> summary.md
fi
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Release Permission Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
```
HTTP 403: Resource not accessible by integration (https://api.github.com/repos/R41CY/movie-scraper/releases)
```

**Root Cause:** 
The default `${{ github.token }}` lacks permissions to create releases.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive error handling for release creation
- Added detailed comments explaining how to fix with Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Made the workflow continue even if release creation fails
- Added fallback error messages with clear instructions

**Instructions for Full Fix:**
1. Create a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope in GitHub Settings
2. Add it as a repository secret named `GH_PAT`
3. Replace `${{ github.token }}` with `${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}` in the workflow

**Workflow Changes:**
```yaml
# Added error handling and instructions
gh release create "$release_tag" \
  --title "$release_name" \
  --notes-file summary.md \
  --latest \
  "imdb_movies_optimized.xlsx#IMDb Movies Data" || {
    echo "Failed to create release. This likely means the GitHub token lacks permissions."
    echo "To fix this, create a PAT with 'repo' scope and add it as a secret named 'GH_PAT'"
    echo "Then change 'github.token' to 'secrets.GH_PAT' in the workflow"
    exit 0
  }
```

## Files Modified

1. **`imdb_scraper_optimized.py`**
   - Fixed NoneType arithmetic in `save_to_excel_optimized()` method
   - Fixed NoneType arithmetic in `_log_performance_metrics()` method

2. **`.github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml`**
   - Enhanced log file processing with proper error handling
   - Added release creation error handling with clear instructions
   - Improved robustness of cleanup operations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run the scraper locally** to verify the Python fixes:
   ```bash
   python imdb_scraper_optimized.py
   ```

2. **Test the workflow** by triggering it manually via GitHub Actions

3. **Monitor logs** to ensure performance metrics are properly logged

4. **Verify Excel file creation** and check the Performance sheet for correct duration calculations

## Additional Improvements Made

- Enhanced error messaging for better debugging
- Added graceful degradation when operations fail
- Improved logging to help identify future issues
- Made the workflow more resilient to partial failures

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while adding robust error handling to prevent future job failures.
